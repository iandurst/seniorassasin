You are Airtable AI. Inside my current base, please create a simple key/value table for my Netlify app:

- Create a table named **kv**.
- Add two fields:
  1) **key** — *Single line text* (primary field)
  2) **value** — *Long text*
- Do not add any extra views or automations.

Next, tell me (as plain text):
- Where I can find the **Base ID** (hint: Help → API documentation → shows appXXXXXXXX).
- What **scopes** I need for a Personal Access Token (`data.records:read`, `data.records:write`).
- How to restrict the token to this base only.

Keep the response concise with bullet points I can copy into Netlify environment variables.
