      <ul>
        <li>All players are notified by SMS immediately.</li>
        <li>A countdown timer may be displayed on the site during the Purge.</li>
        <li>At the end of 3 hours, normal rules automatically resume.</li>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Goggles</strong> — Must be worn properly <em>over the eyes</em>. If pushed up to the forehead/hat or hanging around the neck, they do <em>not</em> count.</li>
