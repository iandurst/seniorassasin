<section id="purge-rules">
  <h2>Purge Window (Admin‑Triggered)</h2>
  <p>The Admin may declare a <strong>3‑hour Purge</strong>. When a Purge starts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All players are notified by SMS immediately.</li>
    <li>A countdown timer will be displayed on the site during the Purge.</li>
    <li>At the end of 3 hours, normal rules automatically resume.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Note:</em> Admin may end the Purge early; if that happens, normal rules resume at once.</p>

<section id="immunity-items">
  <h2>Immunity Items</h2>
  <p>During normal play and during a Purge, the following two items grant temporary immunity <em>only when worn/used exactly as described</em>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Goggles</strong> — Must be worn properly <em>over the eyes</em>. If pushed up to the forehead/hat or hanging around the neck, they do <em>not</em> count.</li>
    <li><strong>Pool Floaties (Arm Floaters)</strong> — <em>Two</em> total (one on <em>each</em> arm) and they must be <em>clearly visible outside</em> of whatever outfit the player is wearing.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>If either item is removed or not worn as specified, the immunity ends immediately.</p>

<section id="admin-reset">
  <h2>Admin Reset</h2>
  <p>For emergencies only. The Admin Reset clears participants, assignments, votes, and resets settings to defaults. Use sparingly.</p>
