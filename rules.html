    <h1>Official Rules</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>1) Safety first</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use only safe, non-harmful equipment as defined by the organizers.</li>
        <li>Be respectful and lawful. Trespassing, harassment, or anything unsafe is not allowed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2) Eligibility & sign up</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Open to PCS seniors.</li>
        <li>Sign up with your real first/last name and a working mobile number you can receive texts on.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) Scoring & eliminations</h2>
      <p><strong>Eliminations will only be counted if they are recorded and sent to 309‑648‑1257 (Ian Durst’s phone number) or shown to Ian at school.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each verified elimination is worth 1 point to the eliminator.</li>
        <li>Admins update the leaderboard after verification.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Safe zones & no‑go times</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School, church, and during or directly after sports practices/games are prohibited.</strong></li>
        <li>Everywhere else is fair game — use common sense and don’t break any laws (especially trespassing).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) Prize pool & weekly vote</h2>
      <p><strong>Entry fee is $5 per player, and the pot grows “Squid Game” style: when a player is eliminated, their $5 is added to the prize pool.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Every Friday during active weeks there is a vote from <strong>3:00–6:00 PM Central Time</strong>.</li>
        <li>Eligible voters: players still in the game (approved & alive) at the time of the vote.</li>
        <li>Two choices: <em>Stop the game</em> or <em>Continue</em>.</li>
        <li>If <strong>75% or more</strong> vote to stop, the game ends and the remaining players split the current prize pool. Otherwise, the game continues.</li>
      </ul>
