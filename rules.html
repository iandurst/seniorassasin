    <h1>Rules</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>1) Safety first</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Only use clearly safe equipment (e.g., foam-dart or water devices if allowed).</li>
        <li>Never play on campus or during school events.</li>
        <li>Respect private property and local laws.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>2) Eligibility & sign up</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Open to PCS seniors only.</li>
        <li>Provide your real name and a reachable phone number for game texts.</li>
        <li>All sign-ups are reviewed by an administrator before joining the game.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>3) Scoring & eliminations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Eliminations count only if they are recorded and sent to <u>309‑648‑1257</u> (Ian Durst) by text, or shown to him at school.</strong></li>
        <li>Admins verify eliminations and update the leaderboard.</li>
        <li>Recording an elimination removes that player from “Alive” and credits 1 elimination to the eliminator.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>4) Safe zones & no‑go times</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School grounds, church, and during or directly after sports practices/games are prohibited.</strong></li>
        <li>Everywhere else: be smart — do not trespass, don’t break laws, and respect people and property.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>5) Prize pool & “Squid Game” style voting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Everyone pays a $5 entry fee.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>The prize pool grows as players are eliminated — each elimination adds $5 to the pot.</strong></li>
        <li>Every Friday while the game is active, there’s a vote from <strong>3:00–6:00 pm Central</strong>.</li>
        <li>Options: <em>Stop the game</em> or <em>Continue</em>. If <strong>75% of remaining (alive) players</strong> vote to stop, the game ends and the remaining players split the prize pool. Otherwise, the game continues.</li>
        <li>Voting happens on the <a href="/vote.html">Voting page</a> using your registered phone number.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>6) Conduct</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Play off school grounds and keep it safe and respectful.</li>
        <li>Admins may remove any player for unsafe or unsportsmanlike behavior.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Immunity Items</h2>
