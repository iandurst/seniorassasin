    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <p class="small">These rules summarize how PCS Senior Assasin will run. Play smart, safe, and with respect for others.</p>

      <h2>1) Safety first</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use only clearly safe equipment if your ruleset allows (e.g., foam-dart or water devices); never bring anything that could be mistaken as dangerous.</li>
        <li>Never play on campus or during school events. Respect people’s space and time.</li>
        <li>Obey local laws at all times.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2) Eligibility & sign up</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Open to PCS seniors.</li>
        <li>Provide your real name and a working mobile number to receive gameplay texts.</li>
        <li>New sign-ups are approved by an administrator before becoming active in the game.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) Scoring & eliminations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Eliminations only count if they are recorded and sent to <a href="sms:+13096481257">309‑648‑1257</a> (Ian&nbsp;Durst) or shown to him at school.</strong></li>
        <li>Admins verify eliminations and update the leaderboard.</li>
        <li>Eliminated players are marked “Out”; eliminators receive +1 elimination.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Safe zones & no‑go times</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>School, church, and during or directly after sports practices/games are prohibited.</strong></li>
        <li>Everything else is generally fair game — but don’t be reckless or trespass. Use common sense and always be respectful.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) Prize pool & weekly vote</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Everyone pays a $5 entry fee. Think “Squid Game” style voting: each Friday at 3:00 PM Central, a vote opens for 3 hours. If at least 75% of the remaining players (active & alive) choose to stop, the game ends and those players split the prize pool. Otherwise, the game continues.</strong></li>
        <li>Each time a player is eliminated, their entry fee is added to the prize pool.</li>
        <li>The prize pool displayed on the home page comes from the entry fee × number of approved participants, unless an admin override is set.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6) Voting details</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Voting opens automatically on Fridays at 3:00 PM Central and lasts 3 hours. Eligible players receive a text link to vote “Stop the game” or “Continue”.</li>
        <li>Votes are per‑player, one time only, and are valid only within the window.</li>
        <li>If ≥75% vote “Stop”, the game ends; otherwise it continues.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="small">These rules may be refined by the administrators for clarity or safety. When in doubt, ask an admin.</p>
