        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> Only use water-based tags (water blasters, cups of water). No dangerous behavior, no property damage, and follow all laws.</li>
          <li><strong>No School Grounds:</strong> No eliminations on school property, at school events, on buses, or during school hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Safe Zones:</strong> Homes, workplaces (with permission), religious buildings, and vehicles while driving are safe zones. Do not pursue or harass.</li>
          <li><strong>Proof of Elimination:</strong> Take a brief photo/video (respect privacy) or have the eliminated player confirm to the admin.</li>
          <li><strong>Honesty Policy:</strong> Eliminated players must report within 24 hours. Lying or harassment can result in removal.</li>
          <li><strong>Purge Day:</strong> Saturdays 8am–midnight CST/CDT are “Purge” hours — anyone can eliminate anyone.</li>
          <li><strong>Admin Decisions:</strong> Admins have final say to resolve disputes and keep the game fair and safe.</li>
