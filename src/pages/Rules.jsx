        <p className="text-white/70">These rules are designed for safety, fairness, and fun. Follow all school policies and local laws. Admins may update rules at any time.</p>

        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> Only use safe, non-harmful props (e.g., water soakers). <em>No real or replica firearms, no dangerous items, no physical contact.</em></li>
          <li><strong>Respect Boundaries:</strong> No play during school hours or on school grounds, buses, or school events. No entering private property without consent. No harassment or stalking.</li>
          <li><strong>Driving & Public Safety:</strong> Do not play while driving or in traffic. Do not cause public alarm; be respectful in neighborhoods and public spaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Only <em>verified</em> players may appear on the official leaderboard. Admins verify sign‑ups before they become active.</li>
          <li><strong>Purge Day (Saturdays 8:00 AM–Midnight CST):</strong> Anyone can eliminate anyone. Standard safety rules still apply.</li>
          <li><strong>Immunity Items (only these are allowed):</strong> Either <em>two pool floaties</em> worn at the same time (one on each arm) <em>or</em> <em>swim goggles worn over the eyes</em>. No other immunity items, costumes, or “shields” are valid.</li>
          <li><strong>Eliminations:</strong> An elimination must be clear and witnessed (photo/video recommended). Report promptly to admins with who eliminated whom and when.</li>
          <li><strong>Honesty:</strong> False reports or attempts to cheat may result in disqualification.</li>
          <li><strong>Prize Pool:</strong> Increases by $5 for every confirmed elimination. <em>Prize distribution</em> occurs at game end per vote/admin decision.</li>
          <li><strong>Voting:</strong> On Sundays, verified players may vote to <em>continue</em> or <em>end & share</em> the current prize pool.</li>
          <li><strong>Admin Decisions:</strong> Admin rulings are final to keep the game safe and fair.</li>
